# magic_star
This code is meant to generate all possible solutions for the magic-star problem. The magic-star problem is a mathematical problem that attempts to put consecutive numbers 1~2n into each vertex of an n-degree star polygon, so that the 4 vertices on each line adds up to the same amount.
This code generates two times the amount of actual unique solutions. Unique solutions means that it cannot be turned into another unique solution by flipping or rotating the solution. Right now the code cannot take care of symmetrical solutions, so each unique solution would be counted twice.
